- **Contribution**: [Rainbow](https://github.com/mycarta/rainbow) - a tool to recover data from scientific images with unknown colourmaps, a project by [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks/) - read more about it in [Matt's blog post](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/5/31/unweaving-the-rainbow) 

- **App**: [Busting bad colormaps](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app/master?urlpath=%2Fpanel%2FDemonstrate_colormap_distortions_interactive_Panel) - a web-based `Panel` app to show the effects of using a bad colormaps; the first version was presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/); you can watch a [video recording of the presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbvueIF5f8&t=510s)
