- **Web app**: [Busting bad colormaps](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app/master?urlpath=%2Fpanel%2FDemonstrate_colormap_distortions_interactive_Panel)  - a web-based `Panel` app to show the effects of using a bad colormap with Geophysical data.  The first version was presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/); you can watch a [video recording of the presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbvueIF5f8&t=510s).

- **Tutorial**: [Working with 3D seismic data in Python using segyio, numpy, Scikit-image](https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/basic/01_basic_tutorial.ipynb). A notebook to demonstrate how to:
    - read a seismic amplitude volume and a seismic similarity volume as `numpy` arrays using `segyio`
    - manipulate the similarity to create a discontinuity / fault volume
    - create a fault mask and display a couple of amplitude time slices with superimposed faults
    - write the fault volume to SEG-Y file re-using the headers from the input file

- **Image augmentation pipelines for Deep Learning**. 
I've worked on two image augmentation pipelines to increase the size of training sets for classification of geologic edges in seismic data, a typically low bias / high variance problem. 
   - I developed the first pipeline to increase the size of training sets for classification of geologic edges in seismic data. The work was commissioned by a company (as a free-lance) and I am not able to share any detail on the image manipulations used. I have permission, however, to disclose that in production tests with Convolutional Neural Networks the approach helped improve performance, and that these efforts paved the path for the company's subsequent coding and investigations.
   - I developed the second pipeline working with the images from the [2018 TGS Salt Identification Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/data) in mind. Although I did not participate in the competition, having considere at length the problem of segmenting salt deposits, I came up with the idea of an "adversarial" augmentation strategy, in which not only the size of the training set is increased, but the task is rendered much harder with the image transformation. Some examples are shown below.  Preliminar tests (unpublished) are encouraging and I am currently working at open-sourcing my functions by way of a PR to the [Augmentor package](https://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html), so that where operations can be added not only in a sequence, but also stochastically with a probability value assigned by the user for each operation.

- **Web app (Hackathon project)**: [Sketch2model](https://github.com/epsalt/sketch2model-web) - a browser-based app to turn back-of-the-napkin geological sketches into geologic models that can then be used to generate synthetic seismic sections. The web app was Built around a prototype put together at the [2015 Calgary Geoscience Hackathon](https://csegrecorder.com/articles/view/open-collaboration-hackathons-and-tomorrows-subsurface-software), organized by [Agile Scientific](https://github.com/agile-geoscience), with team mates [Evan Saltman](https://github.com/epsalt) and [Elwyn Galloway](https://github.com/scibbatical), and special guest [Ben Bougher](https://github.com/ben-bougher) from Agile. The original idea for the prototype was proposed by Elwyn at the Hackathon, was to make an app that would turn an image of geological sketch (for example one taken from a boardmeeting whiteboard) into a digital rock model. The implementation of the finished app involves using morphological filtering and other image processing methods to enhance the sketch and convert it into a model with discrete bodies to be passed to a tool akin to Agile's [modelr.io](https://www.modelr.io/) to create and investigate a synthetic seismic model.

- **Web app (Hackathon project)** : FRIDA (_restore live app and add link here_) - a browser-based app for interactive removal of acquisition footprint noise removal from 3D seismic data. 

Prior to the hackathon I had done a lot of work imagining and protptyping a tool to remove acquisition footprint from 2D seismic slices (this has been my longest-lived side project) and eventually asked [Elwyn](https://github.com/scibbatical) to participate. If you are curious about the whole background, please read [Chapter 39](https://curvenote.com/@swung/52-things-geocomputing/niccoli-keep-on-improving-geocomputing-projects) of the upcoming [52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things) and then head over to my [Tutorial notebook](https://github.com/mycarta/t21-hack-footprint/blob/main/52-things_geocomputing_book_FFT_tutorial.ipynb). For a definition of acquisition footprint, please read the [SEG Wiki](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Dictionary:Acquisition_footprint_or_imprint), and to see some published industry examples, read this [blog post](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2017/08/13/what-is-acquisition-footprint-noise-in-seismic-data). 

At the [2021 Hackathon, Transform virtual conference](https://github.com/softwareunderground/transform-2021-hackathon/discussions) we took the existing tool to the next level with team mates [@leocd91](https://github.com/leocd91), [@WesleyTheGeolien](https://github.com/WesleyTheGeolien),and [@markogauk](markogauk). We spent significant efforts on brainstorming several approaches for how to turn the tool in a production caliber app; check this screen shot of our MIRO board:

And the we set out to work. We were really impressed with the final result, see animation below:

- **Collaboration project**: [Rainbow](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/5/31/unweaving-the-rainbow). For this project with [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks/), I created a pipeline of image processing routines to enhance, clean-up, segment, and rectify the main map from published figures. This was a necessary preprocessing stage for Rainbow, an online tool for automagic recovery data from scientific images with unknown colourmaps. An example of the image processing work is shown is sketched below, with full list of operations in the intro to my blog series [Computer vision in Geoscience](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/computer-vision-in-geoscience-recover-seismic-data-from-images-introduction/), and detailed methodology described in [Part I](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/computer-vision-in-geoscience-recover-seismic-data-from-images-part-1/) and [Part II](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/computer-vision-in-geoscience-recover-seismic-data-from-images-part-2/).

- **Knowledge sharing**: [My answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/15139/144) to the question **In the northern hemisphere only, what percentage of the surface is land?**  on [Stack Exchange Earth Science Beta](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com). This was a lot of fun combining domain knowledge (about map projections) with a tiny bit of Python programming (using `numpy` arrays) to provide a quantitative solution. It is the mini-project I am proud the most of, and I did it out of curiosity and the pure joy of solving a problem!

## Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization portfolio
- Enhanced `seaborn` pairgrid matrix: one of the things I always do when I start looking at a multivariate probelm is to explore possible associations between features and target; one way I've found really useful is to "enhance"  the standard `Seaborn` pairgrid matrix by labeling each bivariate scatter plot with the [distance correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_correlation) colored by p-value, and also rearrage the plots by the results of clustering analysis, like in the example below (you can read more about it [here](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/data-exploration-in-python-distance-correlation-and-variable-clustering/)):

- 3D model of the ternary system quartz ‚Äì nepheline ‚Äì kalsilite, also called petrogeny‚Äôs ‚Äúresidua‚Äù system, which is used to describe the composition of many cooled residual magma. This was an advanced pet project while I was a student in Geology at the University of Rome, Italy. It involved using AutoCAD and 3D Studio Max to create a WRLM file. For the 3D sketchfab version of the model, I used a DXF export and re-rendered using Rhino3D. See the static snapshot below; navigate, inspet, and download the model on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ternary-system-quartz-nepheline-kalsilite-c8225185f7004ad0a23533ca191b0c6b)

- 3D model of the Yoder Tilley tetrahedron for basalt classification. In this visualization the tetrahedron isbroken to separate the Quartz Tholeiite, Oliving Tholeiite, and Alkali Basalt sub-volumes and show the critical planes of silica saturation and silica under-saturation. For the 3D sketchfab version of the model, I used a DXF export and re-rendered using Rhino3D. Check it out [on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/basalt-classification-yoder-tilley-tetrahedron-4d5b741603424850af8946c7316d059a)

- 3D paths of colormap in CIELAB color space. These are a very useful way to analyze a colormap as they show clearly where abrupt chages in contrast happen; these are responsible for artifacts in mapping when these colormaps are used (more details in [this blog post](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/perceptual-rainbow-palette-the-method/) ). As example in the two animations below (produced using¬†the¬†[3D color¬†inspector¬†plugin](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/color-inspector.html)¬†for¬†ImageJ), notice the may abrupt changes in the path for the classic Jet colormap (top) and compary to the regular piraling path of a more perceptual rainbow, called CubicYF (bottom), which I created:
