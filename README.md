## Spotlight
[Busting bad colormaps with Python and Panel](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app/master?urlpath=%2Fpanel%2FDemonstrate_colormap_distortions_interactive_Panel): a web-based app to show the effects of using a bad colormaps; built with `Panel`, `Matplotlib`, a touch of `Scipy`, and a lot of passion!

The first version of the app was presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/); you can watch a [video recording of the presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbvueIF5f8&t=510s).
