## Portfolio highlight
 [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
- **Contribution**: [Rainbow](https://github.com/mycarta/rainbow) - a tool to recover data from scientific images with unknown colourmaps, a project by [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks/) - read more about it in [Matt's blog post](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/5/31/unweaving-the-rainbow)

- **App**: [Busting bad colormaps](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app/master?urlpath=%2Fpanel%2FDemonstrate_colormap_distortions_interactive_Panel) - a web-based `Panel` app to show the effects of using a bad colormap with Geophysical data.  The first version was presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/); you can watch a [video recording of the presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbvueIF5f8&t=510s)

- **Tutorial**: [Working with 3D seismic data in Python using segyio, numpy, Scikit-image](https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/basic/01_basic_tutorial.ipynb). A notebook to demonstrate how to:
    - read a seismic amplitude volume and a seismic similarity volume as `numpy` arrays using `segyio`
    - manipulate the similarity to create a discontinuity / fault volume
    - create a fault mask and display a couple of amplitude time slices with superimposed faults
    - write the fault volume to SEG-Y file re-using the headers from the input file

## Hackathons and sprints
- [2015 Calgary Hackathon](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2015/5/15/canadian-codeshow). The hackathon was organized by [Agile Scientific](https://github.com/agile-geoscience). With teammates [Evan Saltman](https://github.com/epsalt) and [Elwyn Galloway](https://github.com/scibbatical), and special guest [Ben Bougher](https://github.com/ben-bougher) from Agile, built `Sketch2model`, a turns back-of-the-napkin geological sketches into synthetic seismic sections. You can read about it in [Elwyn's blog post](https://scibbatical.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/sketch2model/) and [this one of mine](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/sketch2model-linking-edges-with-mathematical-morphology/)
- [2018 Santa Ana SEG Geophysics Sprint](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2018/10/18/cafe-con-leche). The sprint was organized by [Agile Scientific](https://github.com/agile-geoscience) ahead of the Annual SEG Geophysics Conference. With [Volo Vragov](https://github.com/vragov), worked on some [Geophysical inversion optimization code](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/geophysics-python-sprint-2018-day-2-and-beyond-part-i/) for the [Bruges Python library](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges)
- [2020 Hackathon, Transform virtual conference](https://softwareunderground.org/blog/2020/6/18/transform-2020). The hackathon was organized by the Software Underground group. With teammates [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks) and [Dan Austin](https://github.com/esadan), and a few other contributors, edited several chapters of the upcoming book [52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2020/01/30/about-52-things-you-should-know-about-geocomputing/). You can watch a video recording of the final presentation [here on the group's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/VRoSIjqDj-g?t=277) 

## Stuff I would do differently
- These days I would definitely build this one in Python: [A study of Ricker wavelets in MS Excel (2016)](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/a-study-of-ricker-wavelets-in-ms-excel/)

## Upcoming articles
- [Some advice on reproducing scientific figures](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things/blob/master/chapters/Niccoli_3.md)
- [Keep on improving your Geocomputing projects](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things/blob/master/chapters/Niccoli_2.md)
