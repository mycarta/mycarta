## Portfolio highlight
 [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

- **App**: [Busting bad colormaps](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app/master?urlpath=%2Fpanel%2FDemonstrate_colormap_distortions_interactive_Panel) - a web-based `Panel` app to show the effects of using a bad colormap with Geophysical data.  The first version was presented as a lightning talk at the [Transform 2020 virtual conference](https://transform2020.sched.com/) organized by [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/); you can watch a [video recording of the presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUbvueIF5f8&t=510s). Repo with code [here](https://github.com/mycarta/Colormap-distorsions-Panel-app).

</p>

- **Tutorial**: [Working with 3D seismic data in Python using segyio, numpy, Scikit-image](https://github.com/equinor/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/basic/01_basic_tutorial.ipynb). A notebook to demonstrate how to:
    - read a seismic amplitude volume and a seismic similarity volume as `numpy` arrays using `segyio`
    - manipulate the similarity to create a discontinuity / fault volume
    - create a fault mask and display a couple of amplitude time slices with superimposed faults
    - write the fault volume to SEG-Y file re-using the headers from the input file
<p align="center">
  <img width="650" src="https://mycarta.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/workflow.png">
</p>

- **My first package(work in progress)**: [cmaptools](https://pypi.org/project/cmaptools/), _a collection of functions to analyze and fix bad colormaps_. This is my project for the tutorialthe [Publishing your first Python package](https://transform.softwareunderground.org/2022-first-python-package/overview), attended at the Software Underground [Transform 2022 virtual conference](https://transform.softwareunderground.org/overview). Github [repo here](https://github.com/mycarta/cmaptools).

- **Contribution**: [Rainbow](https://github.com/mycarta/rainbow) - a tool to recover data from scientific images with unknown colourmaps, a project by [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks/) - read more about it in [Matt's blog post](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/5/31/unweaving-the-rainbow)

- **Knowledge sharing**: [My answer](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/15139/144) to the question _In the northern hemisphere only, what percentage of the surface is land?_ on [Stack Exchange Earth Science Beta](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com). This was a lot of fun combining domain knowledge (about map projections) with a tiny bit of Python programming (using `numpy` arrays) to provide a quantitative solution. Ant it was probably one of the most fun mini-projects I did in 2018.

## 3D visualizations
- 3D model of the Yoder Tilley tetrahedron for basalt classification. In this visualization the tetrahedron isbroken to separate the Quartz Tholeiite, Oliving Tholeiite, and Alkali Basalt sub-volumes and show the critical planes of silica saturation and silica under-saturation. For the 3D sketchfab version of the model, I used a DXF export and re-rendered using Rhino3D. Check it out [on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/basalt-classification-yoder-tilley-tetrahedron-4d5b741603424850af8946c7316d059a)
- 3D model of the ternary system quartz ‚Äì nepheline ‚Äì kalsilite, also called petrogeny‚Äôs ‚Äúresidua‚Äù system, which is used to describe the composition of many cooled residual magma. This was an advanced pet project while I was a student in Geology at the University of Rome, Italy. It involved using AutoCAD and 3D Studio Max to create a WRLM file. For the 3D sketchfab version of the model, I used a DXF export and re-rendered using Rhino3D. See the static snapshot below; navigate, inspet, and download the model on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ternary-system-quartz-nepheline-kalsilite-c8225185f7004ad0a23533ca191b0c6b)

- 3D paths of colormap in CIELAB color space. These are a very useful way to analyze a colormap as they show clearly where abrupt chages in contrast happen; these are responsible for artifacts in mapping when these colormaps are used (more details in [this blog post](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/perceptual-rainbow-palette-the-method/) ). As example in the two animations below (produced using¬†the¬†[3D color¬†inspector¬†plugin](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/color-inspector.html)¬†for¬†ImageJ), notice the may abrupt changes in the path for the classic Jet colormap (top) and compary to the regular piraling path of a more perceptual rainbow, called CubicYF (bottom), which I created:

## Hackathons and sprints
- [2015 Calgary Hackathon](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2015/5/15/canadian-codeshow). The hackathon was organized by [Agile Scientific](https://github.com/agile-geoscience). With teammates [Evan Saltman](https://github.com/epsalt) and [Elwyn Galloway](https://github.com/scibbatical), and special guest [Ben Bougher](https://github.com/ben-bougher) from Agile, built `Sketch2model`, an app to turn back-of-the-napkin geological sketches into synthetic seismic sections. You can read about it in [Elwyn's blog post](https://scibbatical.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/sketch2model/) and [this one of mine](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/sketch2model-linking-edges-with-mathematical-morphology/)
- [2018 Santa Ana SEG Geophysics Sprint](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2018/10/18/cafe-con-leche). The sprint was organized by [Agile Scientific](https://github.com/agile-geoscience) ahead of the Annual SEG Geophysics Conference. With [Volo Vragov](https://github.com/vragov), worked on some [Geophysical inversion optimization code](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/geophysics-python-sprint-2018-day-2-and-beyond-part-i/) for the [Bruges Python library](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges)
- [2020 Hackathon, Transform virtual conference](https://softwareunderground.org/blog/2020/6/18/transform-2020). The hackathon was organized by the Software Underground group. With teammates [Matt Hall](https://github.com/kwinkunks) and [Dan Austin](https://github.com/esadan), and a few other contributors, edited several chapters of the upcoming book [52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2020/01/30/about-52-things-you-should-know-about-geocomputing/). You can watch a video recording of the final presentation [here on the group's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/VRoSIjqDj-g?t=277)

## Exploratory Data Analysis favourites
- Enhanced `seaborn` pairgrid matrix: one of the things I always do when I start looking at a multivariate probelm is to explore possible associations between features and target; one way I've found really useful is to "enhance"  the standard `Seaborn` pairgrid matrix by labeling each bivariate scatter plot with the distance correlation colored by p-value, and also rearrage the plots by the results of clustering analysis, like in the example below (you can read more about it [here](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/data-exploration-in-python-distance-correlation-and-variable-clustering/)):

</p>

- At the [2020 FORCE Machine Predicted Lithology challenge](https://xeek.ai/challenges/force-well-logs/overview), I used Ipywidget's interactive and the awesome [`missingno`](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) library to enable browsing exploration wells in the North Sea using a widget and check the chosen well's curves completeness, on the fly, as shown below (you can read more about it [in here](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2020/09/19/geoscience-machine-learning-bits-and-bobs-data-completeness), and try the tool in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mycarta/Force-2020-Machine-Learning-competition_predict-lithology-EDA/blob/master/Interactive_data_inspection_and_visualization_by_well.ipynb)):

## Library
OK, it looks like it has become very trendy these days to post a picture your datascience library. So, I am doing it too then, here is my collection of books, with a focus on computative geoscience and visualization (‚Ä¶ and keeping myself honest about what I have not read, yet‚Ä¶)
